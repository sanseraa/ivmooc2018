					<h3 class="underline faq">Introduction and Resources</h3>
					<p>Indiana University (“IU”) hosts its MOOCs using Instructure’s Canvas platform. You will need an Indiana University Central Authentication Services account in order to participate in the IVMOOC. Your use of that account is subject to Indiana University’s Acceptable Use Agreement [IT-01] and Misuse and Abuse of Information Technology Resources [IT-02], available at <a href="http://policies.iu.edu/policies/categories/information-it/it/IT-01.shtml" target="new">http://policies.iu.edu/policies/categories/information-it/it/IT-01.shtml</a> and at <a href="http://policies.iu.edu/policies/categories/information-it/it/IT-02.shtml" target="new">http://policies.iu.edu/policies/categories/information-it/it/IT-02.shtml</a>.<br>
					<br>
					Your participation in any IVMOOC, and your use of the IU site on which it is made available (the “Site”), are also subject to the following IU Terms of Use.</p>
					<h3 class="underline faq">Acceptance of the Terms of Use</h3>
					<p>By using the Site and participating in an IU MOOC, you are agreeing to these Terms of Use. Please read them carefully before accessing or participating in any chatroom, newsgroup, bulletin board, mailing list, website, transaction, or other on-line forum, course, or service made available by IU. By using the Site and participating in an IU MOOC, you signify and acknowledge that you have read these terms and agree that they constitute a binding legal agreement between you (sometimes referred to as “End User”) and IU, and that you agree to be bound by and comply with the Terms of Use. If you do not agree to be bound by these terms, you may not access the Site or participate in an IU MOOC. IU reserves the right to terminate access to the Site or to any IU MOOC for any End User at any time who violates any of these terms.</p>
					<h3 class="underline faq">Changes to the Terms of Use</h3>
					<p>IU reserves the right to change or modify these Terms of Use or any additional terms at its sole discretion at any time. If you do not agree to the modified terms for the Site or for any IU MOOC, you should discontinue your participation in the MOOC, because your continued participation constitutes binding acceptance of the modified Terms of Use.</p>
					<h3 class="underline faq">Restrictions on Participation</h3>
					<p>Registration and participation in any IU MOOC is restricted to individuals over 18 years of age. By registering or participating in services or functions on the Site, you hereby represent that you are over 18 years of age. You also represent that you will register for each IU MOOC only once. If you do not qualify or do not agree to these terms, you may not use the Site.<br>
					<br>
					Do not misuse the Site or any of the content provided in the MOOC. You may not interfere with the presentation or delivery of the MOOC or try to access the Site or the MOOC using any method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide.<br>
					<br>
					As a condition of accessing the Site, you agree not to (a) reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Site other than as expressly allowed under these Terms of Use; (b) use IU's name, trademarks, server or other materials in connection with, or to transmit, any unsolicited communications or emails; (c) use any high-volume, automated or electronic means to access the Site (including without limitation, robots, spiders, scripts or web-scraping tools); (d) frame the Site, place pop-up windows over its pages or otherwise affect the display of its page; (e) use any manual process to monitor or copy any of the material on the Site or for any other unauthorized purpose; (f) introduce any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs or other material which is malicious or technologically harmful; or (g) otherwise interfere with or disrupt the Site or servers or networks connected to the Site, or disobey any requirements, procedures, policies, or regulations of networks connected to the Site.</p>
					<h3 class="underline faq">Intellectual Property</h3>
					<p>The IVMOOC has been built using Instructure’s Canvas platform pursuant to the Paid Canvas Terms of Use, which is available at <a href="http://www.canvaslms.com/policies/terms-of-use" target="new">http://www.canvaslms.com/policies/terms-of-use</a>.<br>
					<br>
					IU’s MOOCs, and all content or other materials available on the Site, including but not limited to code, images, text, layouts, arrangements, displays, illustrations, audio and video clips, HTML files, and other content, are the property of The Trustees of Indiana University and/or its affiliates or licensors, and are protected by copyright, patent, and/or other proprietary intellectual property rights under the United States and foreign laws. Your participation in any MOOC does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in any of its content.<br>
					<br>
					In consideration for your agreement to the Terms of Use, IU grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and use the Site. You may download material from the Site only for your own personal, non-commercial use. You may not otherwise copy, reproduce, retransmit, distribute, publish, commercially exploit or otherwise transfer any material from the Site, nor may you modify or create derivative works from the material on the Site. The burden of determining that your use of any information, software, or any other content on the Site is permissible rests with you.<br>
					<br>
					These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos from IU or as used in any MOOC.</p>
					<h3 class="underline faq">Data Privacy and Security</h3>
					<p>IU will gather certain personal data from you when you register for an IU MOOC, such as your e-mail address, location, preferences, and responses to certain survey information. IU will only use this personal data for certain limited purposes, including to improve site content and to visualize and display aggregate data as part of the course. IU will use reasonable safeguards consistent with prevailing industry standards and commensurate with the sensitivity of your data to maintain the security of that information on its systems and will never sell your personal data to commercial entities. See the policies available at <a href="http://protect.iu.edu/privacy/policies/electronic-information" target="_blank">http://protect.iu.edu/privacy/policies/electronic-information</a> and <a href="http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/privacy.html</a> for a complete explanation of IU’s privacy practices with respect to its MOOCs.</p>
					<h3 class="underline faq">ADA Accessibility</h3>
					<p>IU has made every effort to provide the Content in its MOOCs in a form that is reasonably accessible to End Users with disabilities, including End Users with visual impairments who use screen reader technologies. Some Content, by its nature, may not be adaptable using such technology, including inherently visual content. If an End User’s accessibility needs extend beyond the accommodations IU has already made, and that End User wishes to request additional accommodations, IU will, consistent with and to the extent required under applicable laws and regulations pertaining to disability access, use commercially reasonable efforts to provide appropriate accommodations in a reasonable timeframe. Please visit <a href="http://iuadapts.indiana.edu/" target="_blank">http://iuadapts.indiana.edu</a> for contact information to request additional assistance.</p>

					<p>The Site includes forums containing the personal opinions and other expressions of the participants, who post entries on a wide range of topics. Neither the User Content (as defined below) on the Site, nor any links to other websites, are screened, moderated, approved, reviewed or endorsed by IU. By posting to or viewing such forums, you agree that IU is not responsible or liable for the content of any postings therein.

					<br>
					You may not use any IU MOOC or any Letter of Completion as part of any tuition-based or for-credit certification or program for any college, university, or other academic institution. Such use of the MOOC or Letter of Completion is a violation of these Terms of Use.</p>
					<h3 class="underline faq">Disclaimer of Student-University Relationship</h3>

					<br>
					The Sites may also provide you with the ability to upload or send information to IU regarding the Site or related services (“Feedback”). By submitting Feedback, you hereby grant IU an irrevocable license to use, disclose, reproduce, distribute, sublicense, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform, and publicly display any such submission.<br>
					<br>
					The rights you grant in these licenses are for the limited purposes of allowing IU to conduct, improve, and further develop its current and future MOOCs and the Site, and allowing the other course participants to collaborate, coordinate, and otherwise participate in the MOOC. These licenses continue even if you stop participating in the MOOC and continue after the MOOC has concluded. By submitting content to the MOOC and/or the Site, you are representing and warranting that you have the necessary rights to grant us these licenses.<br>
					<br>

					<h3 class="underline faq">Online Education Research</h3>
					<p>Records of your participation in the MOOC may be used for researching online education or for creating visualizations of data. In the interests of this research, you may be exposed to slight variations in the course materials that will not substantially alter your learning experience. All research findings and visualizations will be reported at the aggregate level and will not expose your personal identity.</p>
					<h3 class="underline faq">Disclaimer of Warranty / Limitation of Liabilities</h3>
					<p>IU will host and provide the MOOC and the Site using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care.

					<br>
					EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE IU PARTIES WILL NOT HAVE LIABILITY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS FOR DEFAMATION, ERRORS, LOSS OF DATA, OR INTERRUPTION IN AVAILABILITY OF DATA), ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE ANY ONLINE COURSE OR SITE, DATA LOSS, ANY PURCHASES ON THIS SITE, YOUR PLACEMENT OF CONTENT ON A SITE, OR YOUR RELIANCE UPON INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM OR THROUGH ANY ONLINE COURSE OR SITE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTORY, OR OTHER LAW.

					<br>
					YOU AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION RELATED TO THE SITE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</strong></p>
					<h3 class="underline faq">Copyright Policy</h3>
					<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.<br>
					<br>
					If you believe in good faith that materials on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked.<br>
					<br>
					Notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see <a href="http://copyright.iu.edu" target="_blank">copyright.iu.edu</a> for more information and for contact information for DMCA notices.</p>
					<h3 class="underline faq">Indemnification</h3>
					<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless IU and its Trustees, officers, agents, employees, and assignees, including its instructors, from any and all claims, liabilities, expenses and damages, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, made by any third party relating to or arising out of (a) your use or attempted use of the Site or the MOOC in violation of the Terms of Use; (b) your violation of any law or rights of any third party, or (c) information that you post or otherwise make available on the Site or through the MOOC, including without limitation any claim of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property or other proprietary rights.</p>
					<h3 class="underline faq">Termination Rights</h3>
					<p>You agree that IU, in its sole discretion, may terminate your use of the Site or your participation in it thereof, for any reason or no reason, and that none of the IU Parties shall have any liability to you for any such action. You further acknowledge that for the purpose of any course delivered on the Site, your sole relationship with IU is as defined in these Terms of Use; for the avoidance of doubt, you do not have student status at IU and you are not entitled to any grievance or other resolution process for student disputes at IU. You further agree that IU has the right to cancel, delay, reschedule or alter the format of any Online Course at any time, and that none of the IU Parties shall have any liability to you for any such action. If you no longer desire to participate in the Site, you may terminate your participation therein upon notice to IU.<br>
					<br>
					If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, it will not affect any other terms.<br>
					<br>
					The laws of the State of Indiana, U.S.A., excluding Indiana’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or your use of the Site. All claims arising out of or relating to these terms or the Site will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S.A., and you and IU both consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>
