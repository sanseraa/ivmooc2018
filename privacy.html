            <p>This privacy notice applies to the Indiana University IVMOOC (<a href=
            "http://ivmooc2017.cns.iu.edu" target=
            "_blank">http://ivmooc2017.cns.iu.edu</a>) and explains our practices
            concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of participant information.
            Participant information collected by Indiana University will be used only as
            outlined in this privacy notice.</p>
            <p>Other units at the university may collect and use visitor information in
            different ways. Therefore, participants to other university web sites should
            review the privacy notices for the particular sites they visit. Indiana
            University is not responsible for the content of other web sites or for the
            privacy practices of web sites outside the scope of this notice.</p>
            <h3 class="underline faq">Changes</h3>
            <p>Because Internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly, Indiana University
            may make appropriate changes to this notice in the future. Any such changes
            will be consistent with our commitment to respecting participant privacy, and
            will be clearly posted in a revised privacy notice.</p>
            <h3 class="underline faq">Collection and Use</h3>

            as you continue to maintain a relationship with us. Your providing this
            information is wholly voluntary. However, not providing the requested
            information (or subsequently asking that the data be removed) may affect our

            </ul>
            <h4 class="faq">Information Sharing</h4>

            <p>We do not share any personally-identifiable information with other entities
            or organizations, except when legally required to do so, at the request of
            governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce
            compliance with the policies governing our web site and applicable laws, or to

            <h3 class="faq">Use of Third Party Services</h3>
            <p>This web site uses Canvas by Instructure to deliver learning materials.
            Canvas may share your personal information with third party service providers
            for the sole purpose of providing you with the services that we offer you
            through our site. For example, Canvas may share data with service providers who
            host our websites or provide email services on our behalf. For more
            information, please review Canvas Privacy Policy.</p>
            <h3 class="underline faq">Children</h3>
            <p>This site is not directed to children under 13 years of age, does not sell
            products or services intended for purchase by children, and does not knowingly
            collect or store any personal information, even in aggregate, about children
            under the age of 13. We encourage parents and teachers to be involved in
            children's Internet explorations. It is particularly important for parents to
            guide their children when they are asked to provide personal information
            online.</p>
            <h3 class="underline faq">Disclosure of Information</h3>
            <p>Other than sharing your information with other appropriate university
            personnel and units to ensure the quality, functionality, and security of our
            web site, or manage your relationship with us, we will not disclose personally
            identifiable information about your use of the site except under the following
            circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With your prior written (including email) consent</li>
                <li>When we have given you clear notice that we will disclose information that
                you voluntarily provide</li>
                <li>With appropriate external parties, such as law enforcement agencies, in
                order to investigate and respond to suspected violations of law or university
                policy. Any such disclosures shall comply with all applicable laws and
                university policies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="underline faq">Security</h3>
            <p>Due to the rapidly evolving nature of information technologies, no
            transmission of data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely
            secure. While we are committed to protecting the privacy of our participants,
            we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transmit to
            university web sites, and you do so at your own risk. However, once we receive
            your information, we will use reasonable safeguards consistent with prevailing
            industry standards and commensurate with the sensitivity of the data being
            stored to maintain the security of that information on our systems.</p>
            <p>In addition, we will comply with all applicable Federal, State and local
            laws regarding the privacy and security of participant information.</p>
            <h3 class="underline faq">Privacy Notice Changes</h3>
            <p>From time to time, we may use participant information for new, unanticipated
            uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice.</p>
